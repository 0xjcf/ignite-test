# **[Feature Request] Initialize Repository with TypeScript Boilerplate**

---

## **Description**
Set up the igniteTest repository with a clean TypeScript project structure to serve as the foundation for future development.

This feature aims to:
1. Provide a **scalable project structure** for the core implementation and testing.
2. Ensure **modern TypeScript configuration** that aligns with best practices.
3. Install necessary dependencies to enable **immediate development** of ignite-test.

The result will be a repository ready to implement core features and add community contributions.

---

## **Tasks**

### **1. Directory and File Structure**
- [ ] Create a `src` directory for core implementation files.
- [ ] Create a `tests` directory for test cases.

### **2. Configure TypeScript**
- [ ] Add a `tsconfig.json` file with modern TypeScript options:
  - Enable strict mode.
  - Configure output to the `dist` directory.
  - Include source maps for debugging.

### **3. Install Dependencies**
- [ ] Install required dependencies:
  - `typescript` (latest version).
  - `jest` or a similar testing framework.
- [ ] Install dev dependencies:
  - `@types/node`, `@types/jest` (or similar, based on the testing framework).

### **4. Verify Configuration**
- [ ] Create a basic TypeScript file in `src` (e.g., `index.ts`) to verify compilation.
- [ ] Run `tsc` to confirm successful transpilation.
- [ ] Create a sample test file in `tests` to validate the testing setup.

## **Expected Outcome**
1. **Clean Project Structure**:
   - `src` and `tests` directories are created and logically organized for future development.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - A `tsconfig.json` is present and configured for strict, scalable TypeScript usage.

3. **Ready for Development**:
   - All required dependencies are installed, and the repository is ready to begin core implementation and testing.
